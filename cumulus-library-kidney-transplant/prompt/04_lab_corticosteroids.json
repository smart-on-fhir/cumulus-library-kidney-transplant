{
  "Blood Glucose": "Elevated levels (hyperglycemia), potentially leading to steroid-induced diabetes.",
  "Liver Function Tests (ALT, AST, ALP, Bilirubin)": "Elevated liver enzymes, though usually mild and reversible.",
  "Complete Blood Count (CBC)": "Leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) due to demargination of neutrophils.",
  "Electrolytes (Potassium, Sodium, Calcium)": "Hypokalemia (low potassium), hypernatremia (high sodium), and hypocalcemia (low calcium).",
  "Lipid Profile (Cholesterol, Triglycerides)": "Elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increasing cardiovascular risk.",
  "Bone Density (DEXA Scan)": "Decreased bone mineral density, indicating osteoporosis or osteopenia.",
  "C-Reactive Protein (CRP)": "Decreased levels due to anti-inflammatory effects.",
  "Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)": "Decreased levels due to suppression of inflammatory markers.",
  "Adrenal Function Tests (ACTH, Cortisol)": "Suppressed ACTH and cortisol levels, indicating adrenal insufficiency with prolonged use.",
  "Urinalysis": "Glycosuria (glucose in urine) due to hyperglycemia.",
  "Creatine Kinase (CK)": "Reduced levels due to muscle wasting or myopathy.",
  "Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)": "Suppressed levels due to steroid-induced bone metabolism changes.",
  "Serum Uric Acid": "Elevated levels, potentially leading to gout in susceptible individuals.",
  "White Blood Cell Differential": "Neutrophilia (elevated neutrophils), with decreased eosinophils and lymphocytes.",
  "Serum Albumin": "Decreased levels in chronic use due to catabolic effects.",
  "Immunoglobulin Levels (IgG, IgA, IgM)": "Reduced levels due to immunosuppressive effects.",
  "Blood Pressure": "Elevated (hypertension) due to fluid retention and vascular effects.",
  "Bone Turnover Markers (Osteocalcin, CTX)": "Reduced levels, reflecting suppressed bone formation and increased resorption.",
  "Urine Calcium Excretion": "Increased levels, associated with risk of nephrolithiasis or osteoporosis."
