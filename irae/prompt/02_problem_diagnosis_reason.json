{
  "Pneumonitis": "Caused by immune-mediated inflammation of lung tissue due to an overactive immune response targeting pulmonary cells.",
  "Colitis": "Results from immune-mediated inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, primarily the colon, due to dysregulation of immune checkpoints.",
  "Hepatitis": "Occurs when immune activation targets hepatocytes, leading to liver inflammation and dysfunction.",
  "Endocrinopathies": "Caused by immune attack on endocrine glands such as the thyroid, adrenal, or pancreas, disrupting hormonal balance.",
  "Nephritis": "Develops due to immune-mediated damage to renal tissues, often affecting glomeruli or tubules.",
  "Myocarditis": "Triggered by immune infiltration and inflammation of cardiac myocytes, disrupting heart function.",
  "Dermatitis": "Results from immune-mediated attack on skin cells, leading to inflammation and altered skin integrity.",
  "Neurological Toxicities": "Arises from immune system targeting of neural tissue, affecting the central or peripheral nervous system.",
  "Arthritis": "Caused by immune-mediated inflammation of synovial joints, mimicking autoimmune arthritis.",
  "Pancreatitis": "Occurs when immune activation targets pancreatic tissue, leading to inflammation and enzyme dysregulation.",
  "Uveitis": "Results from immune-mediated inflammation of the uveal tract in the eye, impairing visual function.",
  "Thrombocytopenia": "Caused by immune destruction of platelets or suppression of their production in the bone marrow.",
  "Hemolytic Anemia": "Develops due to immune-mediated destruction of red blood cells, often involving autoantibodies.",
  "Lymphocytic Hypophysitis": "Triggered by immune infiltration and inflammation of the pituitary gland, disrupting hormonal regulation."
