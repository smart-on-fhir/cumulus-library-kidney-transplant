{
  "Complete Blood Count (CBC)": "Leukopenia (low white blood cell count), anemia (low red blood cell count), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).",
  "Liver Function Tests (ALT, AST, Bilirubin)": "Elevated liver enzymes or bilirubin levels, indicating possible hepatotoxicity or drug-related liver dysfunction.",
  "Renal Function Tests (Creatinine, BUN)": "Elevated levels indicating potential kidney dysfunction, especially in transplant recipients with preexisting kidney issues.",
  "Serum Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM)": "Reduced levels due to immunosuppressive effects on B-cell function.",
  "C-Reactive Protein (CRP)": "Reduced levels due to suppression of immune and inflammatory responses.",
  "Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)": "Potentially reduced due to the drugâ€™s immunosuppressive effects.",
  "CMV PCR (Cytomegalovirus Polymerase Chain Reaction)": "Elevated viral load, indicating reactivation or infection due to immunosuppression.",
  "EBV PCR (Epstein-Barr Virus Polymerase Chain Reaction)": "Elevated EBV viral load, increasing the risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD).",
  "Blood Glucose": "Elevated levels, potentially contributing to new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT).",
  "Serum Potassium": "Hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels), particularly in patients with kidney impairment.",

  "Urinalysis": "Proteinuria or hematuria, indicating kidney involvement or dysfunction.",
  "T-Cell Subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8)": "Altered counts due to the selective immunosuppressive action on T cells.",
  "D-Dimer": "Elevated levels in cases of thromboembolic events, although rare.",
  "CMV IgG/IgM Antibodies": "Decreased response to infection due to impaired immune surveillance."
